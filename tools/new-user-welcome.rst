===============================
Hello and welcome to Karatbars.
===============================

This is a link to your replicated website:
http://focus.freegold.biz/?s={kbid}
This site will allow you to introduce people to the Karatbars
International business. If you want your picture or skype ID updated,
just send me a link to your picture or provide me with your skype ID
and I will update them promptly.

Once your prospects have purchased their affiliate package, send them
to your tools page so they can instantly get a free replicated website
just like yours:

The essence of Karatbars is finding 2 team players. How to locate
those team players? You have no limits on the number of ways. However
your mentor page lists some possible approaches for you and your team
members to take advantage of:

Now, the above links are *all* you need to build a huge organization in
Karatbars. You can share the opportunity with your first link and you
can send your upgraded sign-ups to your 2nd link so they can get their
free replicated site and some business cards. And if your upgraded
sign-ups are curious about how to locate their 2 team players, provide
them with your third link. And then the whole process repeats.

That being said, there is *one* more link that you may need
occassionally. And that is a link that addresses some very common
questions. So, on your main site ( http://focus.freegold.biz/?s={kbid}
) click on "MORE INFORMATION" and from there click on "much, much,
more." Now you are at your details page -

The details page will answer many common questions that prospective
new affiliates might have before joining with you. And of all
questions, the most common misunderstanding about Karatbars is the
pricing of the product. There is ample information here on that topic.
You can simply direct individuals to this information so that they
can get a full and accurate answer.

Everything else in this email is completely optional. It simply
provides more options for you to customize how you present
Karatbars. If any of it does not make sense, do not hesitate to let me
know.


Several variations on your main replicated site:
------------------------------------------------

Let's look at a few different ways you can tailor your replicated
website. First, let's try a few different videos. The default video
that automatically plays is the corporate video. But there are other
choices available (and I'm open to adding more if you suggest them):

Here is Selina Brantley's video

Here is Lyndon Farrington's video
    http://focus.freegold.biz/?s={kbid}&opener=uk

Here is a simple to-the-point video

Here is a very long video by Joe Norman:

Also, for some people, saving in gold every week is not
affordable. Saving on a monthly basis is more to their liking. They
may also find it a bit challenging to find 2 people within 1 week. For
these people, you are better off presenting Karatbars as a 12-month
plan instead of a 12-week plan:
