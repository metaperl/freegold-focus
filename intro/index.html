    determined by
    inflation, by fluctuations in the dollar and U.S. stocks, by
    currency-related crises, interest rate volatility and international
    tensions, and by increases or decreases in the prices of other
    commodities. The price of gold reacts to supply and demand changes
    and can be influenced by consumer spending and overall levels of
    affluence.</font></p>

    as
    platinum, palladium and silver because the demand for these
    precious metals arises principally from their industrial
    applications. Gold is produced primarily for accumulation; other
    commodities are produced primarily for consumption. Gold's value
    does not arise from its usefulness in industrial or consumable
    applications. It arises from its use and worldwide acceptance as a
    store of value. Gold is money.</font></p>

    perish,
    tarnish or corrode, nor does gold have quality grades . Gold mined
    thousands of years ago is no different from gold mined today.
    Therefore, gold existing in the aboveground gold stock is
    interchangeable with newly mined gold.</font></p>

    deficits,
    loose monetary policy, soaring oil prices and the open-ended costs
    of war. Today, the combined costs of fighting the war in Iraq and
    fighting terrorism at home could match the 12 percent of GDP that

    of the
    great meltdowns in monetary history, gold will reclaim its place at
    the center of the global financial system. Gold's value, relative
    to most national currencies, will soar. "When East Central Bank
    buying outstrips West Central Bank selling, and it will in the
    not-too-distant future, the other remarkably bullish fundamentals
    for gold will take over and drive the gold price to levels that
    most people can scarcely imagine today." (John Embry, Investor's

    The most
    consistent factor determining the price of gold has been inflation
    - as inflation goes up, the price of gold goes up along with it.
    Since the end of World War II, the five years in which U.S.
    inflation was at its highest were 1946, 1974, 1975, 1979, and 1980.
    During those five years, the average real return on stocks, as
    measured by the Dow, was -12.33%; the average real return on gold
    was 130.4%.</font></p>

    create the
    perfect inflationary storm: extremely stimulative monetary policy,
    a major tax cut, a long term decline in the dollar, a spike in oil
    prices, a mammoth trade deficit, and America's status as the

    Economist Stephen Harmston of Bannock Consulting had this to say in

    <font face="Arial">although the gold price may fluctuate, over the
        very long run gold has consistently reverted to its historic
        purchasing power parity against other commodities and intermediate
        products. Historically, gold has proved to be an effective
        preserver of wealth. It has also proved to be a safe haven in times
        of economic and social instability. In a period of a long bull run
        in equities, with low inflation and relative stability in foreign
        exchange markets, it is tempting for investors to expect continual
        high rates of return on investments. It sometimes takes a period of
        falling stock prices and market turmoil to focus the mind on the
        fact that it may be important to invest part of one's portfolio in

<li>Gold is edible. Some Asian countries put gold in fruit, jelly
    snacks, coffee, and tea. Since at least the 1500s, Europeans have
    been putting gold leaf in bottles of liquor, such as Danziger
    Goldwasser and Goldschlager. Some Native American tribes believed
    consuming gold could allow humans to levitate.
</li>
<li>The largest gold nugget ever found is the "Welcome Stranger"
    discovered by John Deason and Richard Oates in Australia on
    February 5, 1869. The nugget is 10 by 25 inches and yielded 2,248
    ounces of pure gold. It was found just two inches below the ground
    surface.
</li>
<li>Amid recession fears in March 2008, the price of gold topped
    $1,000 an ounce for the first time in history.
</li>
<li>Traditionally, investors try to preserve their assets during
    hard economic times by investing in precious metals, such as gold
    and silver. The World Gold Council released a report in February
    2009 that indicated the demand for gold rose sharply in the last
    half of 2008.
</li>
<li>The Dow/Gold ratio, which shows how much gold it would take to
    buy one share of the Dow, is a good indicator of how bad a
    recession is. In early 2009, the Dow/Gold ratio appeared to be
    heading toward the same low ratios that occurred during the 1930s
    and 1980s.
</li>
<li>Gold is chemically inert, which also explains why it never
    rusts and does not cause skin irritation. If gold jewelry irritates
    the skin, it is likely that the gold was mixed with some other
    metal.
</li>
<li>One cubic foot of gold weighs half a ton. The world's largest
    gold bar weighs 200 kg (440 lb).
</li>
<li>In 2005, Rick Munarriz queried whether Google or gold was a
    better investment when both seemed to have equal value on the stock
    market.<sup>h</sup> By the end of 2008, Google closed at $307.65 a

<li>The <a href=
                   "http://www.randomhistory.com/History%20Articles/Olympics.html">Olympic</a>
    gold medals awarded in 1912 were made entirely from gold.
    Currently, the gold medals just must be covered in six grams of
    gold.
</li>
<li>The Incas thought gold represented the glory of their sun god
    and referred to the precious metal as "tears of the Sun." Because
    gold was not yet used for money, the Inca's love of gold was purely
    aesthetic and religious.
</li>
<li>Around 1200 B.C., the Egyptians used unshorn sheepskin to mine
    for gold dust from the sands of the Black Sea. This practice is
    most likely the inspiration for the "Golden Fleece."
</li>
<li>In ancient Egypt, gold was considered the skin or flesh of the
    gods, particularly the Egyptian sun god Ra. Consequently, gold was
    unavailable to anyone but the pharaohs, and only later to priests
    and other members of the royal court. The chambers that held the
    king's sarcophagus was known as the "house of gold."
</li>
<li>The Turin Papyrus shows the first map of a gold mine in Nubia,
    a major gold producer in antiquity. Indeed, the Egyptian word for
    gold was "nub," from gold-rich Nubia. While Egyptian slaves often
    suffered terribly in gold mines, Egyptian artisans who made gold
    jewelry for the nobles enjoyed a high, almost priestly status.
</li>
<li>Though the ancient Jews apparently had enough gold to create
    and dance around a golden calf while Moses was talking to God on
    Mt. Sinai, scholars speculate that it never occurred to the Jews to
    bribe themselves out of captivity because gold was not yet
    associated with money.

<li>There are more than 400 references to gold in the Bible,
    including specific instructions from God to cover furniture in the
    tabernacle with "pure gold." Gold is also mentioned as one of the
    gifts of the Magi.
</li>
<li>The Greeks thought that gold was a dense combination of water
    and sunlight.
</li>
<li>In 560 B.C., the Lydians introduced the first gold coin, which
    was actually a naturally occurring amalgam of gold and silver
    called <em>electrum</em>. Herodotus criticizes the materialism of
    the Lydians, who also were the first to open permanent retail
    shops. When the Lydians were captured by the Persians in 546 B.C.,
    the use of gold coins began to spread.
</li>
<li>Before gold coins were used as money, various types of
    livestock, particularly cattle, and plant products were used as
    currency. Additionally, large government construction projects were
    completed by slave labor due to the limited range of money
    uses.
</li>
<li>The chemical symbol for gold is AU, from the Latin word
    <em>aurum</em> meaning "shining dawn" and from Aurora, the Roman
    goddess of the dawn. In 50 B.C., Romans began issuing gold coins
    called the <em>Aureus</em> and the smaller <em>solidus</em>.
</li>
<li>When honking geese alerted the Romans that the Gauls were about
    to attack the temple where the Romans stored their treasure, the
    grateful Roman citizens built a shrine to Moneta, the goddess of
    warning. The link between rescued treasure and Moneta led many
    centuries later to the English words "money" and "mint."
</li>
<li>Between A.D. 307 and 324, the worth of one pound of gold in
    <a href=
               "http://facts.randomhistory.com/2009/03/07_rome.html">Rome</a> rose
    from 100,000 denarii (a Roman coin) to 300,000 denarii. By the
    middle of the fourth century, a pound of gold was worth
    2,120,000,000 denarii-an early example of runaway inflation, which
    was partly responsible for the collapse of the Roman Empire.
</li>
<li>The Trial of the Pyx (a public test of the quality of gold)
    began in England in 1282 and continues to this day. The term "pyx"
    refers to a Greek boxwood chest in which coins are placed to be
    presented to a jury for testing. Coins are currently tested for
    diameter, chemical composition, and weight.
</li>
<li>During the fourteenth century, drinking molten gold and crushed
    emeralds was used as a treatment for the bubonic plaque.
</li>
<li>In 1511, King Ferdinand of Spain coined the immortal phrase:
    "Get gold, humanely if possible-but at all hazards, get gold."
</li>
<li>Both Greeks and Jews begin to practice alchemy in 300 B.C. The
    search to turn base metals into gold would reach its pinnacle in
    the late Middle Ages and Renaissance.
</li>
<li>In 1599, a Spanish governor in Ecuador taxed the Jivaro tribe
    so excessively that they executed him by pouring molten gold down
    his throat. This form of execution was also practiced by the Romans
    and the Spanish Inquisition.
</li>
<li>Venice introduced the gold ducat in 1284 and it became the most
    popular gold coin in the world for the next 500 years.
    <em>Ducat</em> is Latin for "duke." It is the currency used in
    Shakespeare's <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> and is referenced in
    <em>The Merchant of Venice</em>. In his song "I Ain't the One,"
    rapper Ice Cube sings that "he's getting juiced for his ducats."
    The ducat is also used in the "Babylon 5" sci-fi series as the name
    of the Centauri race's money.
</li>
<li>Originally the U.S. mint made $2.50, $10, and $15 coins of
    solid gold. Minting of gold stopped in 1933, during the <a href=

        Depression</a>.
</li>
<li>The San Francisco 49ers are named after the 1849 Gold Rush
    miners.
</li>
<li>Gold and copper were the first metals to be discovered by
    humans around 5000 B.C. and are the only two non-white-colored
    metals.
</li>
<li>The value of gold has been used as the standard for many
    currencies. After WWII, the United States created the Bretton Woods
    System, which set the value of the U.S. dollar to 1/35th of a troy
    ounce (888.671 mg) of gold. This system was abandoned in 1971 when
    there was no longer enough gold to cover all the paper money in
    circulation.

<li>The world's largest stockpile of gold can be found five stories
    underground inside the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's vault and
    it holds 25% of the world's gold reserve (540,000 gold bars). While
    it contains more gold than Fort Knox, most of it belongs to foreign
    governments.
</li>
<li>The "troy ounce" of gold comes from the French town of Troyes,
    which first created a system of weights in the Middle Ages used for
    precious metals and gems. One troy ounce is 480 grains. A grain is
    exactly 64.79892 mg.
</li>
<li>The gold standard has been replaced by most governments by the
    fiat (Latin for "let it be done") standard. Both Thomas Jefferson
    and Andrew Jackson strongly opposed fiat currency. Several
    contemporary economists argue that fiat currency increases the rate
    of boom-bust cycles and causes inflation.
</li>
<li>The Mines of South Africa can descend as far as 12,000 feet and
    reach temperatures of 130 degrees F. To produce an ounce of gold
    requires 38 man hours, 1400 gallons of water, enough electricity to
    run a large house for ten days, and chemicals such as cyanide,
    acids, lead, borax, and lime. In order to extract South Africa's
    yearly output of 500 tons of gold, nearly 70 million tons of earth
    are raised and milled.
</li>
<li>Only approximately 142,000 tons of gold have mined throughout
    history. Assuming the price of gold is $1,000 per ounce, the total
    amount of gold that has been mined would equal roughly $4.5
    trillion. The United States alone circulates or deposits over $7.6
    trillion, suggesting that a return to the gold standard would not
    be feasible. While most scholars agree a return to a gold standard
    is not feasible, a few gold standard advocates (such as many
    Libertarians and Objectivists), argue that a return to a gold
    standard system would ease inflation risks and limit government
    power.
</li>
<li>The first recorded gold ever discovered in the United States
    was was a 17-pound nugget found in Cabarrus, North Carolina. When
    more gold was discovered in Little Meadow Creek, North Carolina, in
    1803, the first U.S. gold rush began.
</li>
<li>In 1848, while building a saw mill for John Sutter near
    Sacramento, California, John Marshal discovered flakes of gold.
    This discovery sparked the California Gold Rush and hastened the
    settlement of the American West.
</li>
<li>In 1933, Franklin Roosevelt signed Executive Order 6102 which
    outlawed U.S. citizens from hoarding gold. Owning gold (except for
    jewelers, dentists, electricians, and other industry workers) was
    punishable by fine up to $10,000 and/or ten years in prison.
</li>
<li>Tiny spheres of gold are used by the Amersham Corporation of
    Illinois as a way to tag specific proteins to identify their
    function in the human body for the treatment of disease.
</li>
<li>The purity of gold is measured in carat weight. The term
    "carat" comes from "carob seed," which was standard for weighing
    small quantities in the Middle East. Carats were the fruit of the
    leguminous carob tree, every single pod of which weighs 1/5 of a
    gram (200 mg).
</li>
<li>Carat weight can be 10, 12, 14, 18, 22, or 24. The higher the
    number, the greater the purity. To be called "solid gold," gold
    must have a minimum weight of 10 carats. "Pure gold" must have a
    carat weight of 24, (though there is still a small amount of copper
    in it). Pure gold is so soft that it can be molded by hand.

<p><strong>Enduring Characteristics</strong></p>

    <li>Printed (ask a miner how long it takes to find me and dig me
        up)
    </li>

        me)

    <li>Water (I don't rust or tarnish)</li>
    <li>Time (my coins remain recognizable after a thousand years)</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't need:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Feeding (like cattle)</li>
    <li>Fertilizer (like corn)</li>
    <li>Maintenance (like printing presses)</li>
</ul>
<p>I have no:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Time limit (most metal is still in existence)</li>
    <li>Counterparty risk (remember MF Global?)</li>
    <li>Shelf life (I never expire)</li>
</ul>
<p>As a metal, I am uniquely:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Malleable (I spread without cracking)</li>
    <li>Ductile (I stretch without breaking)</li>
    <li>Beautiful (just ask an Indian bride)</li>
</ul>
<p>As money, I am:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Liquid (easily convertible to cash)</li>
    <li>Portable (you can conveniently hold $50,000 in one hand)</li>
    <li>Divisible (you can use me in tiny fractions)</li>
    <li>Consistent (I am the same in any quantity, at any place)</li>
    <li>Private (no one has to know you own me)</li>
</ul>
<p>I am internationally accepted, last for thousands of years, and
    probably most important, you can't make any more of me.</p>

<p><strong>"</strong><strong>Gold Is
    Money</strong><strong>"</strong></p>

<p>You've heard that statement before&nbsp;- but do you know what
    it really means? Money is a medium of exchange and a store of
    value. Almost anything can be used as money, but obviously some
    things work better than others. It's hard to exchange things people
    don't want' and other things don't store value well. Over thousands
    of years, I have emerged as the best form of money (along with
    silver).</p>

<p>The paper dollars in your wallet are technically a currency, not
    real money. In other words, they are a government substitute for
    money. The man you call Aristotle best defined the primary reasons
    why I'm considered money: a good form of money must be durable,
    divisible, consistent, convenient, and have value in and of
    itself.</p>
<ul>
    <li>It must be durable because you can't have your money
        disintegrating in your pocket or bank. That's why you don't use
        wheat; it can rot or be eaten by insects.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>It must be divisible, which is why you don't use diamonds or
        artwork; they can't be split into pieces without destroying the
        value of the whole.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>The lack of consistency is why you can't use real estate. One
        piece is always different from another piece.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>It must be convenient, which is why you don't use other metals
        like lead. The coins would have to be too big to handle easily to
        be of sufficient value.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>It must have value in and of itself. This is why you shouldn't
        use paper as money.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>And one more thing: I can't be created out of thin air. Not
        even the kings and emperors who clipped and diluted gold coins used
        paper as money, so Aristotle didn't include this in his list, but
        it's vital.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>So you see, there's no superstition here. It's simply common
    sense. I am particularly good for use as money, just as aluminum is
    good for making aircraft, steel is good for the structures of
    buildings, uranium is good for fueling nuclear power plants, and
    paper is good for making books. If you try to make airplanes out of
    lead or money out of paper, you're in for a crash.</p>

<p>And by the way, don't fret about those who say I'm not as good
    an asset as an income-producing vehicle. They misunderstand my
    role. I'm not trying to be a stock, for example. My function is as
    money and a store of value, so the proper comparison is to your
    dollars, or what you call Treasury Bills (of similar nominal
    value). And here is where I excel and serve my purpose: since 1913,
    the US dollar has lost 96% of its purchasing power. I have lost
    none.</p>

<p>Remember, I am the only financial asset that is not
    simultaneously someone else's liability. I don't require the
    backing of any bank or government.</p>

<p><strong>The History Lesson</strong></p>

<p>Because I am eons old, I've observed something throughout
    history that you may not have thought much about: government fiat
    currencies are a relatively new invention, and none has endured.
    Eventually, they have all failed. Me? I've never been defaulted on
    or worth zero. Remember this the next time you have any doubts
    about my long-term worth.</p>

<p>Another of my roles is to protect your purchasing power. Here
    are a few examples of how my purchasing power has endured:</p>
<ul>
    <li>During the time of Christ, an ounce of me purchased a Roman
        citizen his toga (suit), a leather belt, and a pair of sandals.
        Today, one ounce will still buy a good suit, a leather belt, and a
        pair of shoes.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>In 400 BC, during the reign of King Nebuchadnezzar, some
        scholars reported that an ounce of me bought 350 loaves of bread.
        Today, an ounce still buys about 350 loaves ($1,700 divided by 350
        = $4.85/loaf).
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>In 1979, my average price was $306.68. This bought an
        average-priced full-size bed. Thirty-three years later, $1,700
        would still buy you a nice full-size bed (and then some).
    </li>
</ul>
<p>You can rest assured that over time, I will hold my value. And
    when you near the end of your life, you can pass me on to your
    loved ones, knowing full well they will have something that cannot
    be devalued, debased, or destroyed.</p>

<p><strong>What Color Is Your Money?</strong></p>

<p>Like you, I'm concerned about the current state of fiscal and
    monetary affairs. It seems your government leaders have boxed
    themselves into a corner. They've incurred <a href=
                                                          "http://www.usdebtclock.org/index.html" target="_blank">too
        much
        debt</a> and are <a href=
                                    "http://articles.cnn.com/2012-02-13/politics/politics_obama-congress-budget_1_trillion-budget-spending-cuts-federal-budget?_s=PM:POLITICS"
                            target="_blank">spending too much money</a>. It's important that
    you understand some lessons from history about this kind of
    behavior so that you're certain of what I can do for you.</p>

<p>The common denominators that lead to the downfall of every fiat
    currency are the two big Ds: debts and deficits. With that in mind,
    consider the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Morgan Stanley reported that there is "no historical precedent"
        for an economy that exceeds a 250% debt-to-GDP ratio without
        experiencing some sort of financial crisis or high inflation. US
        total debt currently exceeds GDP by roughly
        <strong>400%</strong>.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Detailed studies of government debt levels over the past 100
        years show that debts have never been repaid (in original currency
        units) when they exceed 80% of GDP. US government debt will exceed
        100% of GDP this year.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Investment legend Marc Faber reports that once a country's
        payments on debt exceed 30% of tax revenue, the currency is "done
        for." By some estimates, the US will hit that ratio this year.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Peter Bernholz, a leading expert on hyperinflation, states
        unequivocally that "hyperinflation is caused by government budget
        deficits." Next year's US budget deficit is projected to be $1.3
        trillion.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>The solution many of your leaders are pursuing is to <a href=
                                                                   "http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2012/01/living-in-a-qe-world/"
                                                           target="_blank">create more currency units</a>. Here's an
    updated
    picture of the increase in the US monetary base vs. my rise in
    price since 2008, when your problems starting surfacing.</p>

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><a class="lightbox-processed" href=
        "http://www.caseyresearch.com/sites/default/files/GaininMonetaryBasevsGold.png"
                                 rel="lightbox"><img style="WIDTH: 488px; HEIGHT: 332px" alt="" src=
        "http://www.caseyresearch.com/sites/default/files/resize/GaininMonetaryBasevsGold-488x332.png"
                                                     width="488" height="332"></a></p>

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center">(Click on image to enlarge)</p>

<p>The monetary base has grown 205.8%, while my price is up 65.8%.
    This alone implies that my price in dollars is likely to climb much
    higher.</p>

<p>This is also the reason why I'm not in a bubble, as some have
    tried to claim. It is your <em>central banks and bond markets that
        are in a bubble</em><em>.</em> The fact that my price is rising is
    a warning that what your leaders are doing is unsustainable and
    potentially dangerous to your currency.</p>

<p>Think about this: the US has debt backed by debt, based on debt,
    dependent on debt, and leveraged with debt. You can, for example,
    buy a bond (i.e., lend money) on margin (i.e., with borrowed
    money). This is not a sound way to run financial markets.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the warning bells continue to sound regarding
    Europe's debt crisis. In just the past 30 days:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Moody's cautioned that it may cut the triple-A status of
        France, Austria, and the UK; and it downgraded six other European
        nations including Italy, Spain, and Portugal.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Standard &amp; Poor's cut the triple-A status of France and
        Austria, while Italy, Spain, Portugal, Cyprus, Malta, Slovakia, and
        Slovenia were downgraded.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Fitch downgraded Belgium, Cyprus, Italy, Slovenia, and Spain,
        and stated there was a 50% chance of further cuts in the next two
        years.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Standard &amp; Poor's downgraded 34 of Italy's 37 banks.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Moody's warned just last week that it may cut the credit
        ratings of 17 global financial institutions and 114 European
        ones.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>The European crisis is far from over; and the path of least
    resistance for politicians is to create more currency units. This
    action can and will have clear and direct consequences: currencies
    will devalue, and inflation&nbsp;- perhaps hyperinflation&nbsp;-
    will result.</p>

<p>Once again, I encourage you to use me to protect some of your
    wealth.</p>

<p><strong>How Much Is Enough?</strong></p>

<p>Given the state of your monetary system, you should accumulate
    me on a regular basis. Just buy some every month and put it in a
    safe place. After what I've witnessed throughout history, and based
    on the current path your government leaders insist on pursuing, I
    suggest using me as your savings vehicle instead of putting dollars
    in a bank.</p>

<p>If you don't own enough of me when these fiscal troubles really
    accelerate, I fear you will regret it. I've warned many in the past
    about the dilution of nations' currencies, and those who didn't
    heed my warnings experienced severe financial pain. Excuses won't
    pay the mortgage nor feed the family when the effects of currency
    debasement hit your home and pocketbook.</p>

<p>Make sure you own enough of me to make a difference to your
    portfolio. This means having more than a couple.</p>

<p>How do you know if you own enough? Ask yourself:<br></p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>If inflation returns, or even hyperinflation hits...</div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>If the economy is flat...</div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>If uncertainty and fear continue around the globe...</div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>If stock markets languish...</div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>If the amount of spending from the world's governments proves
            futile...
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>If government interference in the economy continues to
            increase...
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>If the value of the US dollar takes a major fall...</div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>If the world enters a recession or depression...</div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>If you wonder if you have enough "safe" money...</div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;...would you feel that you own enough of me?</p>

<p>Buy a sufficient amount so that as your currency continues to
    lose value, your portfolio won't. If you do your part, I promise
    that I'll do mine.</p>

<p>Your monetary friend,</p>

<p>Gold</p>

<p>
    <font size="2" face="Arial">And without knowing&nbsp;all the features and benefits&nbsp;included in KARATBARS, they
        may jump to
        conclusions.&nbsp; They don't know.&nbsp; For many, it may not be that important to them.&nbsp; But&nbsp;for
        those&nbsp;who want the facts will
        get them.<br>
        <br>
        WHY?&nbsp; Because they have NEVER&nbsp;been exposed to anything like this before.&nbsp; KARATBARS is a
        Category-Creator.&nbsp; NO one is doing
        what&nbsp;Karatbars&nbsp;is doing globally.</font>
</p>

<p>
    <font size="2" face="Arial">So LOGICALLY, without some explanation, someone may ASSUME that Karatbars is in some
        kind of "BAKE SALE"

                            that you must do an apples-to-apples
                            comparison. For example, if you are going to buy a pint of milk you must compare the price
                            with other single pints of milk.<br>
                            <br>
                            What you&nbsp;DON'T do is find the best price for a&nbsp;GALLON of milk (which, for the sake
                            of discussion, lets say&nbsp;is $4) and
                            then divide&nbsp;$4 by 8 pints (which is 50 cents per pint), and then compare that price to
                            buying a single pint. We all understand
                            what it means to <strong>buy in bulk</strong>. As with any product, there is what is
                            commonly called <strong>volume
                                discounts</strong>. The reason bulk prices are less per ounce is very simple: there is
                            more labor cost to produce <u>several</u>
                            units verses <u>one</u> unit, but the flexibility of&nbsp;use benefits are significant with
                            1-gram gold over&nbsp;larger weights.<br>
                            <br>
                            To get an accurate price comparison (not taking into consideration the&nbsp;MANY benefits
                            that come with owning a flexible
                            transaction-friendly 1-gram&nbsp;Karatbar),&nbsp;you cannot take the spot price for an
                            <strong>ounce</strong> of gold and divide it
                            by 31.1. (There are roughly 31.1 grams per troy&nbsp;ounce of gold.)&nbsp; And you cannot
                            take a <strong>gram</strong> price and
                            multiply&nbsp;it by&nbsp;31.1. You must price <i>Karatbars gold bullion</i> <strong>by the
                                gram</strong> against other
                            similar-quality gold&nbsp;that's sold <strong>by the gram</strong> to make an accurate
                            comparison.<br></font>

        <h3>The Karatbars Pay Plan</h3>

        <p>
            The purpose of this section is to help you understand the parts of the Karatbars pay plan that really
            matter. If you <a href="data1/images/affiliateplan_en_new.pdf">download</a>
            the affiliate pay plan document, you will see that there are 7 income options. Let me save you some time and
            tell you that:
        <OL>
            <LI>Income options 1-3 are not incredibly lucrative.</LI>
            <LI>Income options 6 and 7 will not matter until you have a gigantic organization or you have purchased the
                VIP Exclusive package
            </LI>
            <LI>The heart and soul of the pay plan are income options 4 (Package Bonus) and 5 (Dual Team Bonus).</LI>
        </OL>
        </p>
        <P>
            Now that I have narrowed down the pay plan to income options 4 and 5, let's note that the Package Bonus is
            not a residual income option. Affiliates are only required to
            purchase a package one time. So read through <a href="data1/images/affiliateplan_en_new.pdf">the pay plan
            document</a> and see how it works.
        </P>

        <P>
            So finally we get to the real meat and potatoes of the pay plan: Income Option #5, the so-called "dual-team"
            or "dual-system" bonus. This income option is truly
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_plan">binary payout</a> regardless of what you might hear. So,
            if the binary is the meat and potatoes, then how do we put food on our plate
            in Karatbars? One thing only: the fact that <i>every gram of gold purchased puts 1 unit in your binary</i>.
            This is what powers your organization and allows for the gigantic yet mathematically
            accurate gains presented in <a meld:id="supreme_team_url2">the 12-week plan to financial freedom.</a>
        </P>
