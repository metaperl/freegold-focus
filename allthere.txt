Daniel,

I'm sending along 20 more pounds because you did a job worth much
more, plus I have a few questions:

1. On [this link](http://focus.freegold.biz/?s=flash73#theplan-link)
how can I get the text of the table of earnings to be white and a bit
larger?

2. On [this
link](http://focus.freegold.biz/?s=flash73#theproduct-link) the title
tab says "THE RESULTS" but it should say "THE PRODUCT"

3. On [this
link](http://focus.freegold.biz/?s=flash73#moreinformation-link)
There is a lot of space between the h6 tags and the paragraph
text.. How can the header not occupy so much vertical space?

4. On [this link](http://focus.freegold.biz/?s=flash73#contact-link)
how can I reduce the space between the CONTACT tab and the iframe?
